 <h1>My favorite movies</h1>
 <h2>Top ranks</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>SuperMan</h3>
 <p>I love SuperMan because he has the power to save
    people from catastrophes and help them out.
 </p>
 <h3>The perks of being a wallflower</h3>
 <p>I think this is one of the best choices for personal
    development if you are a teenager.<br />
    And of course, Emma
    Watson is one of my favorite girls.
 </p>
 <h3>Home Alone</h3>
 <p>When I have fancy and it is Christmas, I enjoy watching the 3rd part of this
    movie. It may be a bit boring, since I saw it many times.
